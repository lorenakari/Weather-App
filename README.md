# Weather-App

Just a simple weather website built using a free version of an api (hence the poorness in information).
It features the forecast for the next five days, a search form and a current location button, among other things.
There is one bug that is kind of the api's fault but I know that I can fix it: if the user views the api after 9 pm, the forecast skips the next day and shows the following ones.
